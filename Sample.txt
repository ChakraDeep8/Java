1)Write a Java program to compute the specified expressions and print the
output.
Test Data:
((25.5 * 3.5 - 3.5 * 3.5) / (40.5 - 4.5))
Expected Output
2.138888888888889
2)Write a Java program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds
all the digits in the integer.
Test Data
Input an integer between 0 and 1000: 565
Expected Output :
The sum of all digits in 565 is 16
3)Write a Java program that prints the current time in GMT.
Test Data
Input the time zone offset to GMT: 256
Expected Output:
Current time is 23:40:24
4)Write a Java program to take the user for a distance (in meters) and the
time taken (as three numbers: hours, minutes, seconds), and display the
speed, in meters per second, kilometers per hour and miles per hour (hint: 1
mile = 1609 meters).
Test Data
Input distance in meters: 2500
Input hour: 5
Input minutes: 56
Input seconds: 23
Expected Output :
Your speed in meters/second is 0.11691531
Your speed in km/h is 0.42089513
Your speed in miles/h is 0.26158804

5)Write a Java program that accepts two integers from the user and prints the
sum, the difference, the product, the average, the distance (the difference
between the integers), the maximum (the largest of the two integers), and the
minimum (the smallest of the two integers).
Test Data
Input 1st integer: 25
Input 2nd integer: 5
Expected Output :
Sum of two integers: 30
Difference of two integers: 20
Product of two integers: 125
Average of two integers: 15.00
Distance of two integers: 20
Max integer: 25
Min integer: 5
6)Write a Java program that will accept an integer and convert it into a binary
representation. Now count the number of bits equal to zero in this
representation.

7)Write a Java program to multiply two given integers without using the
multiply operator (*).
8)Write a Java program to make such a pattern like a pyramid with a number
that repeats in the same row.
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
9)Write a Java method to check whether a string is a valid password.
Password rules:
A password must have at least ten characters.
A password consists of only letters and digits.
A password must contain at least two digits.
10)  Write a Java program to round up integer division results.
